# Final Project For Household Finance: Theory and Applications
### Gabe Morrison
### Spring 2022



### Repo Organization:
Raw data is in the ``data/raw`` folder, and processed data is in ``data/processed`` folder. Scripts used for analyiss begin with ``00``, ``01``, ``02``, and ``03``. Note that I explored the ACS housing and rent data in ``03`` but ultimately did not use it for the analysis. the ``combination_output_script.Rmd`` file contains code pasted from ``00``, ``01``, and ``02`` to show that the code runs and provides outputs. Note that the second chart displays poorly due to the page dimensions, but, when exported, appears as in the paper. ``combination_output_script.pdf`` is the knitted version of this file. 

I also have uploaded a powerpoint slide and a word document describing this research project in the ``presentation`` folder.
